# Spartan-3 Evaluation Kit

# Release Notes - 2/26/2004

If using the Spartan-3 Evaluation board in a PCI slot, remove the fuse labeled "F1"
before applying power to the PC.  The purpose of the fuse is to act as a high-current
shunt to disconnect the on-board voltage regulator from the 3.3V rail when the PCI
slot is powering the 3.3V rail.

Spartan-3 1500 boards -
No additional I/O are connected on the XC3S1500 device so references to the 400 device
apply.  The UCF file is the same for both the 400 and 1500 devices.  The only difference
between a 400 and a 1500 board has to do with the configuration PROMs.  The 1500 board
requires two serial platform flash devices, a XCF04S and a XCF01S (the 400 only requires
one XCF02S device).
